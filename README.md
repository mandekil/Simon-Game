# Simon-Game
This game is exactly Simon game, but in web-based. Just like Simon game, it will raise a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. This game
is one of challenges of [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) I learnt from.

## How to Play Simon Game
You only need to repeat the sequence of the lit color from the beginning in every level by clicking at the right color. You can level up when the color sequence you click
is correct. If you click the wrong color once, the game is over and you can restart the game.
